! Following are the input values entered by the user.
! An entry (a line) should consist of the text: variable_name=value without whitespace in between.
! Variable can be given anywhere (order does not matter).  
! Any text in a line after the first white space is ignored.
! Any text starting with ! character is ignored.
! Any text without = character in the text is ignored.
! Write file paths with \ instead of /. Ex. This\is\example

RHO=30.0            ! Fluid density, kg/m^3
MU=1.0              ! Dynamic viscosity, N*s/m2
P_ATM=101325.0      ! Atmospheric pressure, N/m^2 
K=100000.0          ! Spring constant (stiffness) for fiber nodes, N/m
L=1.0               ! Domain length (equal in all directions) -> cubic domain
Ne=25               ! Number of elements in each direction 
DT=0.000001         ! Time step size, sec
NT=1000000          ! No. of time steps or no. of time steps after last time step (for restart)

! Saving results
save_every=10000     ! Save data every save_every-th time step
result_dir=Result_07_fiber_model  ! Result directory path

! Saving restart file
save_restart_every=100000 ! Save restart file every restart_every-th time step

! Using restart file
use_restart=0                               ! Switch to use restart file
restart_file=Result_02\restart_005000.bin   ! Restart file path
